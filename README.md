# Analyze Stock Data
## Overview of Project
### Steve wants to find the best stock in market for investing and he collects two years data records of 12 stocks in the market. In this project we Help him on decision making process.  Steve also wants to have a high performance code in case he want to use this code for large amount of data in future so we prvide the performance measurment in this project to verify the ability of the code for big data and also we refactor the code to improve the process time.

## Result
### To refactor the code we used array variable and put all process in one loop to prevent multiple process and reduce the output time. 
- we determine three array below array to cllect the result and pass to the summary
''' Dim tickerVolume(12) As Long
    Dim tickerStartingPrice(12) As Single
    Dim tickerEndingPrice(12) As Single
    '''

by preparing summary report in total daily volume for 2017 and 2018 based on the yearly return for these 12 stocks. Total daily volume can show him how actively the stocks was traded and the yearly return shows the percentage increase or decrease in price from the beginning of the year to the end of the year.
